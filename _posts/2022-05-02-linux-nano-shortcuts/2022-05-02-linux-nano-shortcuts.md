title: "Linux: Nano Shortcuts"
date: "2022-05-02"
description: "GNU nano is an easy to use command line text editor for Unix and Linux operating systems. It includes all the basic functionality you would want in a text editor. It offers syntax highlighting, multiple buffer spaces, search and replace with regular expression support, spellchecking, UTF-8 encoding, and more. While it doesn't have the same keybinding library as that of `vi` it does have a number of time-saving shortcuts that if you learn can significantly speed up your workflow."
