When looking at the analytics for evilsaint.com, it always surprises me just how wide an audience this website receives! As a native English speaker who dropped foreign language study at the earliest opportunity school presented, I am amazed at the number of people around the world who take time to read what I post. 

I recently was involved in a panel discussing report writing and some of the associated challenges that people face; we talked at length about many topics from learning difficulties, physical handicaps, educational issues, and language comprehension. 

While the panel discussions sparked many topics, one particular interesting share of note (or at least I felt so), was from a non-native English speaker who has been writing penetration testing reports in English for over six years. 

This person gave the perspective of how they write reports, stating that they often make mistakes when they try and do literal translations from their native language into English. They gave examples and pointed out commonly confused items. Upon asking how they circumvented this problem, they directed me to a resource online which I will now share with you (Please see references below)

This document has assembled many misused English words and expressions that have appeared in EU publications and discusses the correct usage. Even if English is your native language, you might learn something, and I encourage you to do so.
