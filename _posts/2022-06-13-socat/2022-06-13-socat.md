description: "In today's article, we will look at Socat. Socat is a network utility similar to Netcat. Socat supports IPv6 and SSL and is available for both Windows and Linux. The first thing you will notice with this tool is that it has a different syntax than what you are used to with Netcat or other standard Unix tools."

# Socat


```
socat [options] <address> <address>
```

You have to provide both addresses for it to work, each address will be made up like this
```
protocol:ip:port
```

Examples showing the same functionality as Netcat

```
nc localhost 80
socat - TCP4:localhost:80 
OR 
socat STDIN TCP4:localhost:80

nc -lp localhost 700
socat TCP4-LISTEN:700 STDOUT

nc -lp localhost 700 -e /bin/bash
socat TCP4-LISTEN:700 EXEC:/bin/bash
```

We can go beyond Netcat with some SSL examples, but first, we need to generate an SSL cert for the server. Generate an SSL cert
```
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout cert.key
```

SSL server

```
socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:443,cert=/cert.pem -
```

SSL client

```
socat - OPENSSL:localhost:443
```

Both addresses donâ€™t have to use the same protocol, so you can do `ssl server -> non-ssl server`. You should also check out the options that you can apply, for example you can use fork to tell socat to listen and handle multiple clients.

```
socat TCP4-LISTEN:5000,fork OPENSSL:localhost:443
```

Finally if you are tunnelling a connection between servers using socat you can use the -v option to print all the traffic to stdout.
